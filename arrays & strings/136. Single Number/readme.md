1st approach:
- we check each value with XOR that will give us the only element which is single(as XOR returns a value 0 when checked with same value )

2nd approach
- we sort the array
- as elements are twice we loop twice
- and check if 1st and 2nd elements are same the move or return the element as it is not same 
- finally if the element is last we return the last element
